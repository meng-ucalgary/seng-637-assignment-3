## Comments and feedback

1. This assignment has given us a great opportunity in learning how to make sure the test cases we write are complete and cover most of the source code effectively.

2. EclEmma was used as the code coverage tool, which is already available Eclipse as an installed plugin.

3. The assignment description document [`Assignment3.md`](Assignment3.md) is very detailed and comprehensive, and it was easy to follow.
